We're A Miracle

Here we are
Safe at last
We can breathe a sigh
It seems the storm has passed
Through it all
No one knew
That all the tears in heaven
Would bring me back to you
No one I know imagined we would make it
But it only matters that we both believe

(Chorus) You and me, we're a miracle
Meant to be and nothing can change it.
Mountains move and oceans part
When they are standing in our way
You and me, we're a miracle
Angels stand watching over us
And heaven shines upon us every day

Every time
I felt defeat
You were there for me
On my side completely
You give me strength
You set me free
Just as because of you I'm more then I can be
When I'm with you
The world is ours to reach for
Together, there is nothing we can do
(Chorus)

The chance was so unlikely
That we would ever be
Two stars among the heavens
Destiny brought you to me
(Chorus)

You and me, we're a miracle
You and me, we're a miracle
Miracle
